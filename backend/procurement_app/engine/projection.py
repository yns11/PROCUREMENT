"""Stock projection, coverage and target stock for one article.

Core recurrence (per day ``d`` after the snapshot day)::

    stock[d] = stock[d-1] + supply[d] + adjustments[d] - demand[d]

Three cumulative stock layers are projected (see ``runner.py``):

* **firm stock** – on-hand stock + *committed* supply (ERP firm orders / schedule lines, app
  orders sent to the supplier, receipts and adjustments posted after the snapshot);
* **forecast stock** – firm + ERP forecast schedule lines (DELFOR);
* **simulated stock** – forecast + planned (app) orders + scenario orders + engine proposals.

A physical stock can never be negative.  ``shortage_policy`` decides what happens to the
demand that cannot be served:

* ``backlog`` (default, MRP "projected available balance") – the unserved demand is carried
  forward: the *net* balance goes negative and the next receipts serve the backlog first.
  ``stock = max(net, 0)`` and ``shortage = max(-net, 0)`` (cumulated backlog);
* ``lost`` – the unserved demand is lost (production is not caught up):
  ``stock[d] = max(stock[d-1] + supply[d] + adjustments[d] - demand[d], 0)`` and ``shortage[d]``
  is the quantity that could not be served on day ``d``.

Coverage on day ``d`` = number of *future* days whose cumulated demand is covered by
``stock[d]`` (calendar or working days).  Target stock on day ``d`` = demand of the next
``coverage_target_days`` days (+ optional fixed safety stock).
